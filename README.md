# Probability-Calculator-for-N-sided-Dice
A program that calculates the probability distribution when rolling M number of N-sided dice.

## Method 1: rollDice(int sides, int numberOfDice) 

Simulates rolling M number of N-sided dice once and returns the sum of the outcomes.

## Method 2: simulateRolls(int sides, int numberOfDice, int numRolls)

Simulates rolling M number of N-sided dice K times and record the results.

## Method 3: calculateProbability(int sides, int numberOfDice, int numRolls)

Calculates the probability of each possible sum when M number of N-sided dice are rolled.

## Main method: takes user input and displays results

Allows the user to input the values of N, M, K and display the probability distribution.
